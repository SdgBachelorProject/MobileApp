## Branch prefixes

While creating new branches in this project we will use convention described below:
```
  feature/* - features during implementation merged into main branch
  fix/* - branches used to fix bugs
  experimental/* - experimental feature that maybe will be merged into the main branch
  refactor/* - tasks related to code refactoring
  improvement/* - small improvements that do not require code refactoring
  ```
